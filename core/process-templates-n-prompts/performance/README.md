# Performance Optimization Framework

## Overview
The Performance Optimization Framework provides comprehensive guidance for maximizing system efficiency, user experience, and resource utilization. It covers application performance, database optimization, caching strategies, and scalability engineering aligned with AI-DLC principles for 50-80% productivity gains.

## Framework Components

### 1. AI Context (`performance-prompt.md`)
- Specialized performance optimization expertise context
- Integration points with other AI-DLC frameworks
- Context-aware guidance for different performance requirements
- 6-day development cycle approach

### 2. Development Checklist (`performance-checklist.md`)
- **Phase 1**: Performance assessment and planning (Days 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Application and database optimization (Days 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: Frontend and infrastructure optimization (Day 5)
- **Phase 4**: Monitoring and continuous optimization (Day 6)

### 3. Optimization Templates (`performance-template.md`)
- k6 load testing configurations
- Database query optimization examples
- Caching implementation patterns
- Frontend performance optimization
- Performance monitoring dashboards
