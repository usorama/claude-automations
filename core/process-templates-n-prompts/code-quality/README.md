# Code Review & Quality Framework

## Overview
The Code Review & Quality Framework provides comprehensive guidance for establishing and maintaining high standards for code quality, maintainability, and team collaboration. It covers code review processes, static analysis, testing strategies, and quality metrics aligned with AI-DLC principles for 50-80% productivity gains.

## Framework Components

### 1. AI Context (`code-quality-prompt.md`)
- Specialized code quality expertise context
- Integration points with other AI-DLC frameworks
- Context-aware guidance for different team sizes and experience levels
- 6-day development cycle approach

### 2. Development Checklist (`code-quality-checklist.md`)
- **Phase 1**: Quality standards and process design (Days 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Automated quality checks and CI integration (Days 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: Review processes and team training (Day 5)
- **Phase 4**: Metrics, reporting, and continuous improvement (Day 6)

### 3. Quality Templates (`code-quality-template.md`)
- ESLint and static analysis configurations
- Pull request templates and review checklists
- CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
- Testing configurations and pre-commit hooks

## Key Features

### Automated Quality Enforcement
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint, SonarQube, TypeScript for code quality
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection and dependency checking
- **Test Coverage**: Enforced coverage thresholds and quality gates
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Quality checks before code commits

### Collaborative Review Process
- **Structured Reviews**: Templates and checklists for consistent reviews
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Mentorship and learning opportunities
- **Fast Feedback**: 24-hour review turnaround targets
- **Constructive Culture**: Focus on learning and improvement

### Continuous Improvement
- **Quality Metrics**: Track defect rates, review effectiveness, team satisfaction
- **Technical Debt**: Systematic identification and management
- **Process Optimization**: Data-driven process improvements
- **Team Development**: Ongoing training and skill enhancement

## Success Metrics

### Quality Targets
- **Review Coverage**: 100% of code changes reviewed before merge
- **Review Time**: Average turnaround time <24 hours
- **Defect Rate**: <1 critical defect per 1000 lines of code in production
- **Test Coverage**: >80% code coverage across all projects

### Team Effectiveness
- **Technical Debt**: Ratio <5% as measured by static analysis
- **Team Satisfaction**: >90% developer satisfaction with review process
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Measurable skill development across team
- **Process Efficiency**: Reduced time spent on manual quality checks

This framework enables teams to maintain high code quality while fostering a collaborative culture of continuous learning and improvement.
