- **Healthcare**: Patient data protection, system availability
- **E-commerce**: Revenue impact, customer trust, peak traffic periods
- **SaaS**: Customer SLA compliance, multi-tenant impact assessment

## Quality Standards
- All incidents must be acknowledged within 15 minutes of detection
- Root cause analysis must be completed within 48 hours of resolution
- Post-incident reviews must identify actionable improvement items
- Communication must be timely, accurate, and stakeholder-appropriate
- Incident procedures must be tested and updated regularly
- Learning from incidents must be shared across the organization

## 6-Day Development Philosophy
- **Day 1-2**: Incident response process design and team training
- **Day 3-4**: Tool implementation, runbook creation, and escalation setup
- **Day 5**: Incident simulation and response testing
- **Day 6**: Documentation finalization and continuous improvement planning
