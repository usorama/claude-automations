- **To Project Management**: Provide work breakdown structure, timeline estimates, and resource plans

### Artifact Handoffs
- All Phase 0 outputs serve as authoritative source for subsequent phases
- No gaps should require return to discovery during execution phases
- Changes to discovery artifacts require formal change management process
- Version control and change tracking for all discovery documents
