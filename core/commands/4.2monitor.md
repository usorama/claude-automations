# Phase 4.2: Monitoring & Observability

**ðŸ“Š Phase 4 of 5: Deployment - System Observability**

## Framework Activation
Activates the **Monitoring Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/monitoring/`

## What This Enables
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure and resource monitoring
- Distributed tracing and logging aggregation
- Alerting and incident detection
- Metrics dashboards and reporting

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: `/4.1deploy` (Deployment) - system must be running
- **Critical for**: Production system health and reliability
- **Enables**: `/4.3perf` (Performance optimization), `/5.1incident` (Response)
- **Supports**: Operational excellence and SLA maintenance

## Key Deliverables
- APM and infrastructure monitoring setup
- Centralized logging and distributed tracing
- Alert rules and escalation procedures
- Performance dashboards and metrics
- SLA monitoring and reporting

## Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive monitoring stack
2. Configure alerts and notification channels
3. Validate monitoring coverage and accuracy
4. Activate `/4.3perf` for performance optimization
5. Prepare `/5.1incident` for incident response
