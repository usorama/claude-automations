- Emergency response procedures and escalation
- Post-incident analysis and improvement
- Service recovery and business continuity
- Communication and stakeholder management

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 4 complete (deployed, monitored, optimized)
- **Always-on**: Critical for production system reliability
- **Works with**: `/4.2monitor` (Alert integration), all system components
- **Foundation**: Essential before scaling operations

## Key Deliverables
- Incident response playbooks and procedures
- Alert routing and escalation workflows
- Post-incident review and improvement processes
- Service recovery and rollback procedures
- Communication templates and stakeholder updates

## Next Steps
1. Implement incident response procedures
2. Test emergency response capabilities
3. Train team on incident management
4. Activate `/5.2integrate` for system integrations
5. Scale with `/5.3data` for data operations
