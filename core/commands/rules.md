- Test-driven development with AI
- Mandatory code reviews for AI-generated code
- Context-aware development practices

### 🧪 **Testing & Validation Rules**
- Write tests first, then generate code
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements
- AI-specific testing considerations
- Quality assurance integration

### 📚 **Documentation & Compliance Rules**
- EU AI Act compliance (2024-2025)
- NIST framework adherence
- Clear labeling of AI-generated content
- Maintain audit trails

### 🏗️ **Dependency & Architecture Rules**

- Proper dependency management
- Architecture review requirements
- Package documentation verification

### 🤖 **AI-Specific Development Rules**
- Responsible AI code generation
- Context-aware AI usage
- AI output validation and testing
- Governance and approval processes

## 🚨 **Critical Safety Reminders**

### **Non-Negotiable Requirements**
- **Planning First**: Always plan before implementing
- **Security by Design**: Integrate security throughout development lifecycle  
- **Human Oversight**: Maintain human control and accountability
- **Complete Testing**: Comprehensive validation before deployment
