# Phase 0.2: Solution Definition & Requirements

**ðŸ“‹ Phase 0 of 6: Discovery & Definition - Requirements Engineering**

## Framework Activation
Activates the **Discovery Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/discovery/` for detailed solution definition and comprehensive requirements engineering.

## What This Enables
- Transform business needs into detailed functional requirements
- Define comprehensive non-functional requirements
- Create user stories with acceptance criteria
- Establish technical assumptions and constraints
- Develop epic breakdown with implementation roadmap

## Input Methods Supported
1. **Project Brief Processing**: Use completed Project Brief from `/0.1discover` as foundation
2. **Requirements Documents**: Process existing technical specifications or user stories  
3. **Interactive Requirements Engineering**: Guided sessions for detailed requirements elicitation

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: Completed Project Brief from `/0.1discover`
- **Enables**: `/0.3validate` (Validation & Feasibility)
- **Phase**: Phase 0 of 6: Discovery & Definition

## Key Deliverables
- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: Complete technical requirements
  - Detailed functional requirements (FR1, FR2, etc.) with acceptance criteria
  - Non-functional requirements with measurable targets
  - User interface design goals and interaction paradigms
  - Technical assumptions and architecture constraints
  - Epic breakdown with user stories and Definition of Done
  - Testing requirements and quality gates

## Success Criteria
- All requirements traceable to business objectives
- User stories have clear acceptance criteria and Definition of Done
- Non-functional requirements have measurable, testable targets
- Technical assumptions validated or flagged for architecture review
- 100% stakeholder approval on requirements completeness

## Requirements Coverage Areas
- **Functional**: Core business logic, data processing, integrations
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, scalability targets
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Usability**: User experience standards, accessibility requirements
- **Compliance**: Regulatory, industry standards, audit requirements
- **Operational**: Monitoring, maintenance, support requirements

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Use PRD as input to `/0.3validate` for feasibility validation
2. Upon Phase 0 completion, PRD becomes authoritative source for:
   - `/1.1arch` - System architecture and design
   - `/1.2ux` - User experience research and design
   - `/1.3security` - Security architecture and compliance

## Usage Examples
**From Project Brief**:
"Use this completed Project Brief to create a comprehensive PRD with detailed functional requirements and user stories."

**From Existing Requirements**:
"I have partial technical specifications. Transform these into a complete PRD following the discovery framework."

**For Interactive Definition**:
"Guide me through requirements engineering to create user stories and acceptance criteria from my business objectives."

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are measurable and testable  
- [ ] Epic breakdown covers complete user workflows
- [ ] Technical assumptions documented for architecture validation
- [ ] Requirements traceability to business objectives verified
