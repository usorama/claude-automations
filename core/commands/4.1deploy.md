# Phase 4.1: Deployment & DevOps

**ðŸš€ Phase 4 of 5: Deployment - Release Automation**

## Framework Activation
Activates the **Deployment Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/deployment/`

## What This Enables
- CI/CD pipeline automation and orchestration
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provisioning
- Container orchestration and service mesh
- Blue-green and canary deployment strategies
- Release management and rollback procedures

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 3 Quality (all tests passing, docs complete)
- **Critical Gate**: Production readiness validation
- **Enables**: `/4.2monitor` (Monitoring), `/4.3perf` (Performance)
- **Launches**: Live system operations

## Key Deliverables
- CI/CD pipeline configurations and automation
- Infrastructure provisioning and management
- Container images and orchestration manifests
- Deployment strategies and rollback procedures
- Release documentation and runbooks

## Next Steps
1. Configure deployment pipelines and infrastructure
2. Execute initial production deployment
3. Activate `/4.2monitor` for system observability
4. Implement `/4.3perf` for performance optimization
5. Prepare Phase 5 Operations capabilities
