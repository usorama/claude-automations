# Phase 2.4: ML Development (Optional)

**ðŸ¤– Phase 2 of 5: Development - Machine Learning**

## Framework Activation
Activates the **ML Development Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/ml-development/`

## What This Enables
- Machine learning model development and training
- Data pipeline and feature engineering
- Model deployment and inference services
- ML monitoring and performance tracking
- AI/ML integration with application features

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: `/2.1feature`, `/2.2api`, `/2.3db` recommended
- **Optional**: Only activate if ML capabilities required
- **Integrates with**: Data layer and API services
- **Supports**: Intelligent features and automation

## Key Deliverables
- ML models and training pipelines
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Model serving and inference APIs
- ML monitoring and evaluation metrics
- AI/ML feature integration

## Next Steps
1. Develop ML models and training workflows
2. Integrate with existing features and APIs
3. Implement model serving infrastructure
4. Proceed to Phase 3 with ML-specific testing
5. Plan ML deployment and monitoring
