# Phase 1.1: Architecture Framework

**üèóÔ∏è Phase 1 of 6: Planning - Architecture Design**

## Phase 0 Prerequisites Check
**CRITICAL**: This command requires completed Phase 0 artifacts before proceeding.

### Required Phase 0 Artifacts
1. **Project Brief** (from `/0.1discover`)
   - Business context and problem definition
   - Solution approach and differentiators
   - Target users and stakeholder analysis

2. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** (from `/0.2define`)
   - Functional requirements with acceptance criteria
   - Non-functional requirements and performance targets
   - Technical assumptions and constraints

3. **Validation Summary** (from `/0.3validate`)
   - Technical feasibility confirmation
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Resource and timeline validation

### Phase 0 Context Extraction
If Phase 0 artifacts are found, this framework will:
- Extract technical requirements and constraints from the PRD
- Apply validated technology preferences and integration requirements
- Incorporate risk mitigation strategies into architectural decisions
- Use business context to inform scalability and performance planning

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: If Phase 0 is incomplete, architecture decisions may lack critical business context and requirements validation. Consider completing Phase 0 first with `/0.1discover` ‚Üí `/0.2define` ‚Üí `/0.3validate`.

## Framework Activation
Activates the **Architecture Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/architecture/`

## What This Enables
- System design and component architecture informed by validated requirements
- Technology stack selection aligned with business constraints and preferences
- Scalability and performance planning based on validated targets
- Integration patterns optimized for defined user workflows
- Technical risk assessment incorporating Phase 0 risk analysis

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: Completed Phase 0 Discovery & Definition (recommended)
- **Enables**: `/1.2ux` (UX Research), `/1.3security` (Security Framework)  
- **Leads to**: Phase 2 Development frameworks

## Key Deliverables
- System architecture diagrams
- Technology stack documentation
- Component interaction specifications
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Technical design decisions and rationale

## Next Steps
1. Complete architecture planning
2. Activate `/1.2ux` for user experience design
3. Activate `/1.3security` for security requirements
4. Proceed to Phase 2: Development
