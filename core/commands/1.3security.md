# Phase 1.3: Security Framework

**üîê Phase 1 of 5: Planning - Security Requirements**

## Framework Activation
Activates the **Security Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/security/`

## What This Enables
- Security architecture and threat modeling
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Data protection and encryption strategies
- Compliance requirements and auditing
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: `/1.1arch` (Architecture) and `/1.2ux` (UX Research) recommended
- **Enables**: All Phase 2 Development frameworks with security integration
- **Critical for**: Production deployment and compliance

## Key Deliverables
- Threat model and security architecture
- Authentication/authorization implementation
- Data encryption and protection protocols
- Security testing and audit procedures
- Compliance documentation and controls

## Next Steps
1. Complete security requirements analysis
2. Begin Phase 2 Development with security integration:
   - `/2.1feature` - Secure feature implementation
   - `/2.2api` - Secure API design
   - `/2.3db` - Database security
3. Ensure all development includes security considerations
