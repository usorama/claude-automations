# Phase 3.1: Code Review & Quality

**üîç Phase 3 of 5: Quality - Code Standards**

## Framework Activation
Activates the **Code Quality Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/code-quality/`

## What This Enables
- Code review processes and quality gates
- Static analysis and linting automation
- Code coverage and quality metrics
- Technical debt identification and management
- Best practices enforcement and guidelines

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 2 Development (features, API, database)
- **Quality Gate**: Must pass before deployment
- **Enables**: `/3.2test` (Testing), `/3.3docs` (Documentation)
- **Critical for**: Production readiness and maintainability

## Key Deliverables
- Code review guidelines and checklists
- Static analysis and linting configurations
- Quality metrics and coverage reports
- Technical debt assessment and remediation
- Code standards documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement code quality processes
2. Run static analysis and address issues
3. Activate `/3.2test` for comprehensive testing
4. Proceed to `/3.3docs` for documentation
5. Prepare for Phase 4 Deployment
