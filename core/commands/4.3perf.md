# Phase 4.3: Performance Optimization

**âš¡ Phase 4 of 5: Deployment - System Performance**

## Framework Activation
Activates the **Performance Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/performance/`

## What This Enables
- Application performance profiling and optimization
- Database query optimization and caching
- CDN and asset optimization strategies
- Load balancing and auto-scaling configuration
- Performance testing and benchmarking

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: `/4.1deploy` (Deployment), `/4.2monitor` (Monitoring)
- **Data-driven**: Uses monitoring data for optimization decisions
- **Enables**: Phase 5 Operations scaling capabilities
- **Continuous**: Ongoing optimization based on real usage

## Key Deliverables
- Performance analysis and optimization reports
- Database and query optimization implementations
- Caching strategies and CDN configuration
- Auto-scaling and load balancing setup
- Performance benchmarks and SLA validation

## Next Steps
1. Analyze current performance metrics
2. Implement optimization strategies
3. Validate performance improvements
4. Begin Phase 5 Operations with `/5.1incident`
5. Scale system capabilities with `/5.2integrate` and `/5.3data`
