# Phase 0.3: Validation & Feasibility Check

**âœ… Phase 0 of 6: Discovery & Definition - Validation & Feasibility**

## Framework Activation
Activates the **Discovery Framework** from `~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/discovery/` for comprehensive validation and feasibility assessment before Phase 1 handoff.

## What This Enables
- Multi-dimensional risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Technical feasibility validation and constraint analysis
- Market opportunity validation and competitive positioning
- Resource requirements planning and budget justification
- Complete success metrics framework with baseline establishment

## Input Methods Supported
1. **Discovery Package Processing**: Validate completed Project Brief + PRD package
2. **Risk Assessment Focus**: Deep-dive risk analysis for high-risk projects
3. **Market Validation**: Comprehensive competitive and opportunity analysis
4. **Resource Planning**: Detailed budget and timeline validation

## Phase Context
- **Prerequisites**: Completed Project Brief (`/0.1discover`) + PRD (`/0.2define`)
- **Completes**: Phase 0 Discovery & Definition
- **Phase**: Phase 0 of 6: Discovery & Definition

## Key Deliverables (Based on Project Needs)

### Always Required
- **Validation Summary**: Executive readiness assessment for Phase 1
- **Risk Register**: High-priority risks with mitigation strategies  
- **Feasibility Confirmation**: Technical, market, and resource feasibility

### Recommended Based on Project
- **Market Analysis**: Competitive landscape and opportunity assessment
- **Success Metrics Framework**: KPIs, OKRs, and measurement methodology
- **Resource Plan**: Detailed budget, timeline, and team requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive multi-dimensional risk analysis

## Validation Dimensions
- **Business Feasibility**: Market demand, competitive differentiation, ROI validation
- **Technical Feasibility**: Implementation complexity, integration challenges, scalability
- **Resource Feasibility**: Budget availability, skill requirements, timeline realism
- **Risk Acceptability**: Risk/reward balance, mitigation effectiveness, contingency planning

## Success Criteria for Phase 0 Completion
- [ ] Zero critical gaps requiring return to discovery in Phase 1
- [ ] All high-priority risks have documented mitigation strategies
- [ ] Technical feasibility validated or flagged for architecture deep-dive
- [ ] Resource requirements align with available budget and timeline
- [ ] Stakeholder confidence >90% in project definition and approach
- [ ] Go/No-Go recommendation with clear justification

## Phase 1 Readiness Gates
- [ ] **Architecture Readiness**: Complete technical requirements package
  - Functional/non-functional requirements with acceptance criteria
  - Technology constraints and preferences documented
  - Integration requirements and system boundaries defined
  
- [ ] **UX Readiness**: Complete user experience requirements package  
  - User personas and journey maps validated
  - UI/UX design goals and principles established
  - Accessibility and branding requirements defined
  
- [ ] **Security Readiness**: Complete security requirements package
  - Data sensitivity and compliance requirements documented
  - Authentication/authorization requirements specified
  - Security monitoring and incident response requirements

## Phase 1 Commands Unlocked After Completion
- **`/1.1arch`** - Architecture Framework (system design, technology stack)
- **`/1.2ux`** - UX Research Framework (user research, interface design)
- **`/1.3security`** - Security Framework (security architecture, compliance)

## Usage Examples
**Complete Package Validation**:
"Validate this Project Brief and PRD package. Assess feasibility and readiness for Phase 1 architecture and design."

**Risk-Focused Validation**:
"This is a high-risk project with significant technical challenges. Focus validation on risk assessment and mitigation planning."

**Market-Focused Validation**:
"Validate the market opportunity and competitive positioning. Include comprehensive market analysis and go-to-market considerations."

## Deliverable Selection Guidance
- **Startup/MVP Projects**: Focus on Project Brief + PRD + Risk Assessment
- **Enterprise Projects**: Include all deliverables for comprehensive planning
- **High-Risk Projects**: Emphasize Risk Assessment and Resource Planning
- **Market Entry**: Prioritize Market Analysis and Success Metrics Framework

## Quality Gates Before Phase 1
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off on all deliverables (>90% confidence)
- [ ] No "TBD" or incomplete sections in any document
- [ ] Requirements traceability verified end-to-end
- [ ] Phase 1 teams identified and available
- [ ] Budget approval and resource allocation confirmed
