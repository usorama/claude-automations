# Agent Command Structure Report

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Redundant `/orchestrate` Command
- **Status**: Deprecated and redirected to `/so`
- **Reason**: `/so` (SuperOrchestrator) is THE master orchestrator for everything
- **Action**: `/orchestrate` now redirects users to use `/so` instead

### 2. ✅ BMAD Agent Commands Now Have Proper Prefix
- **Status**: All BMAD agents moved to root commands directory with `bmad-` prefix
- **Before**: `/BMad/agents/analyst.md`
- **After**: `/bmad-analyst.md`

**BMAD Commands Now Available**:
- `/bmad-analyst` - Requirements gathering and user research
- `/bmad-architect` - System design and technical architecture  
- `/bmad-dev` - Development implementation
- `/bmad-pm` - Project management
- `/bmad-po` - Product owner responsibilities
- `/bmad-qa` - Quality assurance
- `/bmad-sm` - Scrum master duties
- `/bmad-ux-expert` - UX design and research
- `/bmad-completion-enforcer` - Quality gatekeeper
- `/bmad-master` - Universal BMAD task executor
- `/bmad-orchestrator` - BMAD-specific orchestration

### 3. ✅ SuperOrchestrator (`/so`) Clarified
- **Purpose**: ONLY orchestration, NEVER execution
- **Updated Rules**:
  - MUST ONLY orchestrate - NEVER write code or execute tasks
  - MUST delegate ALL work to specialist agents
  - Acts as conductor, not performer
  
### 4. ✅ Clear Agent Separation

**BMAD Agents** (prefix: `/bmad-`):
- Focused on BMAD methodology
- Requirements, architecture, development lifecycle
- Story creation, validation, completion enforcement

**Other Specialist Agents** (no prefix):
- Engineering: frontend-developer, backend-architect, ai-engineer
- Design: ui-designer, ux-researcher, whimsy-injector
- Testing: test-writer-fixer, qa-agent, performance-benchmarker
- Operations: project-shipper, infrastructure-maintainer

**Orchestration Hierarchy**:
```
/so (SuperOrchestrator)
├── Orchestrates ALL agents and tasks
├── Never executes, only delegates
│
├── BMAD Agents (/bmad-*)
│   ├── /bmad-orchestrator (BMAD-specific orchestration)
│   ├── /bmad-analyst
│   ├── /bmad-architect
│   └── ...
│
└── Other Agents
    ├── frontend-developer
    ├── backend-architect
    └── ...
```

## Command Usage Examples

### SuperOrchestrator (Master of Everything)
```
/so create a user authentication system
```
→ SO analyzes, routes to bmad-analyst for requirements, then appropriate developers

### BMAD-Specific Commands
```
/bmad-analyst gather requirements for chat feature
/bmad-architect design microservices architecture
/bmad-dev implement user story US-001
```

### Direct Specialist Commands  
```
/ui create responsive dashboard
/backend implement REST API
/checkpoint before major refactor
```

## Key Principles

1. **`/so` is the master orchestrator** - Use for any complex task needing coordination
2. **BMAD agents have `/bmad-` prefix** - Clear differentiation from other agents
3. **SuperOrchestrator ONLY orchestrates** - Never writes code or executes tasks
4. **Clear agent separation** - BMAD methodology vs. specialized execution agents

## Testing the Structure

To verify the fixes work:
1. Try `/so analyze and optimize codebase` - Should delegate to agents
2. Try `/bmad-analyst define requirements` - Should invoke BMAD analyst
3. Try `/orchestrate anything` - Should redirect to `/so`
