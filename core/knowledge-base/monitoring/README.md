# Monitoring & Observability Framework

## Overview
The Monitoring & Observability Framework provides comprehensive guidance for building visibility into system performance, health, and user experience. It covers metrics collection, logging, tracing, alerting, and SLO management aligned with AI-DLC principles for 50-80% productivity gains.

## Framework Components

### 1. AI Context (`monitoring-prompt.md`)
- Specialized monitoring and observability expertise context
- Integration points with other AI-DLC frameworks
- Context-aware guidance for different system scales and complexities
- 6-day development cycle approach

### 2. Development Checklist (`monitoring-checklist.md`)
- **Phase 1**: Monitoring strategy and infrastructure setup (Days 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Metrics collection and logging implementation (Days 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: Dashboards and alerting configuration (Day 5)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced analytics and optimization (Day 6)

### 3. Monitoring Templates (`monitoring-template.md`)
- Prometheus configuration and alert rules
- Grafana dashboard definitions
- Application instrumentation examples
- Logging configuration and SLO setup

## Key Features

### Three Pillars of Observability
- **Metrics**: Time-series data for system and business KPIs
- **Logs**: Detailed event information for debugging and analysis
- **Traces**: Request flow tracking across distributed systems

### Proactive Monitoring
- **SLI/SLO Management**: Service level objectives and error budgets
- **Predictive Alerting**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- **Business Metrics**: User experience and conversion tracking
- **Cost Monitoring**: Resource usage and optimization opportunities

### Operational Excellence
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Executive, operational, and technical views
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Actionable alerts with minimal noise
- **Incident Response**: Automated escalation and runbook integration
- **Compliance Reporting**: Audit trails and regulatory compliance

## Success Metrics

### Detection & Response
- **MTTD (Mean Time to Detection)**: <5 minutes for critical issues
- **MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution)**: <30 minutes for critical incidents
- **Alert Accuracy**: >95% of critical alerts require immediate action
- **Coverage**: 100% monitoring for critical services and dependencies

### System Reliability
- **SLO Achievement**: Meet or exceed defined service level objectives
- **Dashboard Adoption**: >90% of team members actively use dashboards
- **Monitoring Uptime**: >99.9% availability for monitoring systems
- **Data Retention**: Appropriate retention policies for different data types

This framework enables teams to build comprehensive observability systems that provide actionable insights while maintaining high reliability and operational efficiency.
