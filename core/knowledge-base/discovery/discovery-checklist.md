# Phase 0 Discovery Checklist

This comprehensive checklist ensures complete business discovery before proceeding to Phase 1 (Architecture, UX, Security). Use this as both a task list and quality gate.

## Usage Instructions

**Option 1: Task Checklist Mode**
- Work through each section systematically
- Check off completed items as you progress
- Ensure all "CRITICAL" items are completed
- Use "RECOMMENDED" items based on project complexity

**Option 2: Interactive Q&A Mode** 
If you prefer guided discovery, respond with "START INTERACTIVE" and I'll walk you through each section with targeted questions and examples.
