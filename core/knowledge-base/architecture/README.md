## 📈 Success Patterns

### Start Simple, Evolve Gradually
1. Begin with modular monolith
2. Identify service boundaries
3. Extract services when needed
4. Scale based on actual load

### Design for Change
- Use abstractions and interfaces
- Implement feature flags
- Plan for deprecation
- Version everything

### Build for Operations
- Observability from day one
- Automate everything possible
- Document runbooks
- Plan for failures

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Over-Engineering
- ❌ Microservices for simple apps
- ❌ Premature optimization
- ❌ Complex patterns without need
- ❌ Technology for technology's sake

### Under-Engineering

- ❌ Ignoring security requirements
- ❌ Missing monitoring
- ❌ No disaster recovery

### Poor Practices
- ❌ Undocumented decisions
- ❌ Tight coupling
- ❌ Single points of failure
- ❌ Manual processes
