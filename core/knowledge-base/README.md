## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: Guided Orchestration (Recommended)
```bash
/start [project-name]  # Launch complete 6-day development cycle
/phases               # View all phases and activation order
```

### Method 2: Phase-Based Activation
Follow the numbered commands for optimal workflow:
```bash
# Phase 1: Planning (Days 1-2)
/1.1arch      # Architecture design
/1.2ux        # User research
/1.3security  # Security planning

# Phase 2: Development (Days 3-4)
/2.1feature   # Feature development
/2.2api       # API development
/2.3db        # Database design
/2.4ml        # ML development (optional)

# Continue through phases 3-5...
```

### Method 3: Direct Framework Access
Use standard commands for specific frameworks:
```bash
/arch     # Architecture framework
/api      # API development
/test     # Testing framework
# See full list below
```

### Project Configuration
Each project uses `PROJECT_CONFIG.yaml` to track:
- Framework activation status
- Phase completion progress
- Technology stack decisions
- Team configuration
- Success metrics

Initialize your project:
```bash
cp ~/.claude/process-templates-n-prompts/PROJECT_CONFIG.yaml .claude/
```
