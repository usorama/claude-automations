## Critical Constraints

Before starting any work, you MUST read and understand these manifests:

**Required Context Files:**
- `@.claude/manifests/CODEBASE_MANIFEST.yaml` - Overall codebase structure and organization
- `@.claude/manifests/FUNCTION_REGISTRY.md` - All available functions and their purposes  
- `@.claude/manifests/EXPORT_REGISTRY.json` - Module exports and public interfaces
- `@.claude/manifests/CODE_PATTERNS.md` - Established patterns and conventions
- `@.claude/manifests/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.json` - Module relationships and dependencies
- `@.claude/manifests/ERROR_HANDLING.md` - Error handling patterns and practices
- `@.claude/manifests/PROJECT_CONTEXT.yaml` - Project-specific configuration
- `@.claude/manifests/TYPE_DEFINITIONS.ts` - TypeScript type definitions

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Prevents Silent Failures** - Understanding existing error handling prevents bugs
2. **Maintains Consistency** - Following patterns keeps code maintainable
3. **Avoids Duplication** - Knowing existing functions prevents recreating them
4. **Enables Smart Decisions** - Understanding structure helps make better choices

**Before Implementation:**
1. Load manifests: `python3 ~/.claude/hooks/pre-agent-context.py`
2. Check branch: `.claude/hooks/suggest-branch.sh`
3. Create checkpoint after work: `python3 ~/.claude/hooks/auto-checkpoint-hook.py --now`

**Validation Requirements:**
- Follow patterns from CODE_PATTERNS.md
- Use utilities from FUNCTION_REGISTRY.md
- Maintain types from TYPE_DEFINITIONS.ts
- Never create empty catch blocks
- Always handle errors appropriately
