# PRISM - Proactive Real-time Intelligence System for Manifests
## Claude Code Context Optimization System

---

## üéØ What is PRISM?

PRISM is an LLM-driven context engineering system built **exclusively for Claude Code**. It transforms how Claude Code agents receive context - from loading 200KB+ of mostly irrelevant manifests to receiving intelligently selected, task-specific context through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

**Think of it this way**: 
- **Before PRISM**: Agents are given an entire library when they need one book
- **With PRISM**: Agents receive exactly the chapters they need, when they need them

---

## üöÄ Core Purpose

**PRISM exists for ONE reason**: Make Claude Code agents more effective by giving them precisely the context they need through intelligent LLM-based selection rather than dumping everything.

### The Problem PRISM Solves
- Agents currently load 200KB+ of context
- Only ~10% is actually relevant to their task
- Context window gets bloated with unnecessary information
- Agents struggle to find what they need in the noise

### The PRISM Solution
- LLM analyzes task intent and selects relevant manifests
- Context engineered specifically for each agent and task
- Quality prioritized over arbitrary size constraints
- Continuous learning from usage patterns

## üìä SIPOC Architecture

```
SUPPLIER ‚Üí INPUT ‚Üí PROCESS ‚Üí OUTPUT ‚Üí CUSTOMER
```

- **SUPPLIER**: Claude Code hooks collecting manifest data
- **INPUT**: Manifests stored in SQLite database
- **PROCESS**: LLM (Ollama) + MCP tools for context optimization
- **OUTPUT**: Optimally engineered context package
- **CUSTOMER**: Claude Code Agents (100+ specialists)

## üîß How PRISM Works

### 1. Interception
When you invoke an agent with the Task tool, PRISM intercepts via PreToolUse hook

### 2. Analysis
PRISM analyzes your task description using Ollama LLM to understand intent

### 3. Selection
Based on intent, PRISM queries SQLite for relevant manifests

### 4. Engineering
LLM engineers optimal context - not constrained by size, focused on quality

### 5. Delivery
Context delivered to agent via MCP tools

### 6. Learning
PRISM tracks what worked and continuously improves

## üí° For Claude Code Agents

**If you're a Claude Code agent reading this**, here's what you need to know:

1. **PRISM is being built FOR YOU** - Every feature serves agent effectiveness
2. **You'll access PRISM via MCP tools** - No file manipulation needed
3. **Your context will be optimized automatically** - No action required
4. **Quality over quantity** - You'll get what you need, not everything
5. **It learns from you** - The more you use it, the better it gets

### How to Use PRISM (Once Deployed)

```python
# As an agent, you'll be able to:
prism_tools.get_optimal_context(
    agent_type="frontend-developer",
    task="implement user authentication"
)
# Returns: Only auth-related manifests, not entire codebase
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

### What We're Optimizing For
- **Context Relevance**: >95% (from ~10% currently)
- **Agent Success Rate**: +20% improvement
- **Response Time**: <1 second
- **Continuous Learning**: Gets smarter with use

### What We're NOT Optimizing For
- Arbitrary size limits (like <20KB)
- Speed at the cost of quality
- One-size-fits-all solutions

## üìà Vision

**The End Goal**: Every Claude Code agent receives perfectly tailored context for their specific task, leading to:
- Faster task completion
- Higher success rates
- Less token usage
- Better code quality
- Happier developers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **PRISM is Claude Code specific** - Not a general-purpose tool
2. **Quality > Size** - We don't constrain to arbitrary limits
3. **LLM-driven** - Uses Ollama for intelligent decisions
4. **Learning system** - Improves with every use
5. **MCP-based** - Clean integration via Model Context Protocol
