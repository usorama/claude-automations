## 🎯 Quick Start
Copy this entire block and paste at the start of your new Claude Code session.

## 📊 Session Summary
Created a reusable prompts system with `/start-prompt` and `/continuation-prompt` commands for Claude Code. Implemented comprehensive context engineering for seamless session handoffs with metadata tracking and versioning.

## ✅ Completed in This Session
- [x] Removed postgres MCP server from configuration
- [x] Configured Supabase MCP with authentication token
- [x] Created reusable-prompts folder structure
- [x] Implemented /start-prompt command v1.0.0
- [x] Implemented /continuation-prompt command v1.0.0

## 🔄 Work in Progress
```yaml
current_task: "Creating continuation prompt example and documentation"
files_editing: 
  - reusable-prompts/daily/continuation-prompt.md (completed template)
  - core/commands/continuation-prompt.md (slash command implementation)
next_action: "Test continuation prompt with actual session data"
```

## 📋 Pending Tasks
1. [ ] Add context optimization logic for intelligent file selection
2. [ ] Create comprehensive example output
3. [ ] Update README with both prompt commands
4. [ ] Test PRISM integration for context optimization
5. [ ] Commit changes with detailed message

## 📁 Critical Files to Read
```bash
# Read these files first for context (in priority order)
1. ./CLAUDE.md                                    # Project rules and automation philosophy
2. ./reusable-prompts/daily/start-prompt.md       # Start prompt implementation
3. ./reusable-prompts/daily/continuation-prompt.md # Continuation prompt template
4. ./core/commands/continuation-prompt.md         # Slash command implementation
5. ./reusable-prompts/README.md                   # Prompts system documentation
6. ~/.claude-code/mcp/global.json                 # MCP configuration (10 servers)
7. ./rules.md                                     # AI development guidelines
```

## 🎨 Key Decisions & Context
```yaml
decisions:
  - choice: "Used metadata versioning for all prompts"
    reason: "Track improvements and enable rollback"
    impact: "All prompts must include version headers"
  
  - choice: "Separate compact/full modes for continuation"
    reason: "Balance between context and token efficiency"
    impact: "Default to compact (<500 lines) unless specified"

  - choice: "File scoring system for context selection"
    reason: "Intelligently prioritize critical files"
    impact: "Max 10-15 files in compact mode"

patterns_observed:
  - "User prefers /xall for enhanced thinking"
  - "User wants zero-friction automation"
  - "Context engineering is critical for continuity"
  - "Everything should 'just work' automatically"
```

## 🚧 Active Problems/Blockers
```yaml
blockers:
  - issue: "PRISM MCP integration not fully tested"
    details: "Need to verify context optimization works"
    next_try: "Run test with prism.get_optimal_context()"

notes:
  - "MCP servers require Claude Code restart to apply changes"
  - "Archon SSE server may not be running (localhost:8051)"
```

## 🔀 Environment State
```bash
# Repository state
branch: main
uncommitted_files: 47 (mostly PRISM-related)
staged_changes: 0
last_commit: "3dce32f - feat: Implement PRISM Unified Intelligence System"

# MCP Servers configured: 10
- context7 (working)
- github, memory, fetch, playwright (working)
- sequential-thinking, shadcn-ui-server (working)
- supabase (configured with token)
- prism (custom, working)
- archon (SSE, may need startup)

# Environment
PRISM_ENABLED=true
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_a62f...
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Prioritized)
```markdown
1. **Immediate** (< 5 min)
   - [ ] Run `/continuation-prompt` to test output
   - [ ] Verify file scoring logic works correctly
   - [ ] Check that all critical files exist

2. **Continue Work** (Current session focus)
   - [ ] Complete README updates
   - [ ] Test PRISM integration if available
   - [ ] Generate full example with real data

3. **Next Priority** (After current task)
   - [ ] Commit all changes with smart commit
   - [ ] Test both prompts in new session
   - [ ] Document in main CLAUDE.md
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist
Run these commands to verify environment matches:
```bash
# Verify git state
git branch --show-current           # Should show: main
git status --short | wc -l          # Should show: 47 files

# Verify prompts installation
ls -la ~/claude-automations/reusable-prompts/daily/
ls -la ~/claude-automations/core/commands/*prompt*

# Check MCP servers
jq '.mcpServers | keys' ~/.claude-code/mcp/global.json
```

## 💬 Conversation Context
```yaml
user_preferences:
  - "Deep research before implementation"
  - "Comprehensive, reusable solutions"
  - "Metadata and version tracking"
  - "Commands should be universally applicable"
  
established_patterns:
  - "Always use TodoWrite for task tracking"
  - "Test with actual project data"
  - "Include examples and documentation"
  - "/xall triggers enhanced thinking"

custom_commands_used:
  - /xall (enhanced thinking mode)
  - /start-prompt (new creation)
  - /continuation-prompt (new creation)
```

## 📝 Notes for Next Session
```
- Both prompt commands are now available immediately in Claude Code
- The prompts system is designed to grow with more templates
- Consider adding: /analyze-codebase, /review-pr, /test-suite
- PRISM integration could significantly improve context selection
- File scoring algorithm may need tuning based on usage
```
