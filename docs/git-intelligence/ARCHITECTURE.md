# Git Intelligence System Architecture

## Vision
Transform Claude Code git operations from reactive automation to proactive intelligence, where every git decision is context-aware, collaborative, and meaningful.

## Core Principle
**One thing done right**: Focus exclusively on intelligent git operations during Claude Code sessions. Every other feature waits until this works perfectly.

## System Architecture

### 1. Context Layer
**Purpose**: Understand what Claude Code just accomplished

**Components**:
- `GitStateAnalyzer`: Tracks repository state before/after work
- `WorkContextExtractor`: Understands what was accomplished from changes
- `PatternRecognizer`: Identifies work patterns (bug fix, feature, refactor, etc.)

**Data Flow**:
```
File Changes → Pattern Analysis → Work Context → Semantic Understanding
```

### 2. Intelligence Layer
**Purpose**: Make smart decisions based on context

**Components**:
- `CommitIntelligence`: Generates meaningful commit messages
- `BranchIntelligence`: Suggests appropriate branching strategies
- `PRIntelligence`: Determines when work is PR-ready
- `WorkflowIntelligence`: Recommends next git operations

**Decision Tree**:
```
Work Context → Impact Assessment → Git Strategy → User Recommendations
```

### 3. Interaction Layer
**Purpose**: Collaborate with user for final decisions

**Components**:
- `SuggestionPresenter`: Shows git recommendations with reasoning
- `UserDialogue`: Handles approve/modify/skip interactions
- `ExecutionManager`: Safely executes approved operations
- `FeedbackCollector`: Learns from user choices

**User Flow**:
```
Claude Completes Work → Analysis → Suggestions → User Decision → Execution
```

### 4. Learning Layer
**Purpose**: Improve suggestions over time

**Components**:
- `PatternTracker`: Records accepted/rejected suggestions
- `PreferenceEngine`: Learns user's git style preferences
- `SuccessMetrics`: Tracks outcome quality
- `AdaptiveOptimizer`: Refines decision algorithms

**Feedback Loop**:
```
User Decision → Pattern Storage → Algorithm Tuning → Better Future Suggestions
```

## Integration Points

### Claude Code Hooks

**PostToolUse Hook** (Primary):
- Triggers after Edit, MultiEdit, Write operations
- Analyzes changes and suggests git operations
- Non-blocking, user-collaborative

**Stop Hook** (Session End):
- Ensures clean git state before session ends
- Suggests final commits/PRs if needed
- Prevents abandoned work

**UserPromptSubmit Hook** (Context Injection):
- Adds git context to user prompts when relevant
- Enables git-aware responses

### Event Triggers

1. **Significant Work Completion**:
   - Multiple file edits complete
   - Test suite passes
   - Feature implementation done

2. **Natural Pause Points**:
   - User asks "what's next?"
   - Task completion
   - Before starting new work

3. **Risk Moments**:
   - Large number of changes accumulating
   - Before complex operations
   - Context switch detection

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Post-Work Git Suggestions (Week 1)
**Goal**: Never have uncommitted work after Claude completes tasks

**Deliverables**:
- Basic change analyzer
- Simple commit message generator
- User approval interface
- Git execution wrapper

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero instances of 100+ uncommitted changes
- 80% of suggested commits accepted/modified (not skipped)
- Clean git state after every session

### Phase 2: Intelligent Branching (Week 2)
**Goal**: Appropriate branch strategies for different work types

**Deliverables**:
- Work type classifier
- Branch naming intelligence
- Branch lifecycle management
- Merge strategy recommendations

**Success Criteria**:
- Meaningful branch names aligned with work
- No more commits directly to main
- Clear branch history

### Phase 3: PR Workflow Intelligence (Week 3)
**Goal**: Well-structured PRs with proper context

**Deliverables**:
- PR readiness detector
- Description generator
- Review assignment suggestions
- Merge conflict prevention

**Success Criteria**:
- PRs created at logical completion points
- Rich PR descriptions with context
- Reduced review cycles

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.9+**: Primary implementation language
- **GitPython**: Git repository manipulation
- **Click**: CLI interface for user interaction
- **Rich**: Terminal UI for suggestions
- **JSON**: Configuration and state storage

### Claude Code Integration
- **Hooks System**: Event-driven triggers
- **Bash Tool**: Git command execution
- **Settings.json**: Hook configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Context passing

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Every component tested in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Hook integration with Claude Code
3. **User Acceptance Tests**: Real workflow validation
4. **Regression Tests**: Prevent feature degradation

### Monitoring & Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: % of work ending with proper git state
- **Suggestion Quality**: Accept/modify/skip ratios
- **Time Saved**: Reduction in git operation time
- **Error Rate**: Failed operations or conflicts

### Validation Checkpoints
- [ ] Every Claude session ends with clean git state
- [ ] Commit messages accurately reflect work done
- [ ] Branch strategies align with work types
- [ ] User reports improved git workflow
- [ ] No silent failures in git operations

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Over-automation**: Making decisions without user input
   - **Mitigation**: Always present suggestions, never auto-execute

2. **Context Misunderstanding**: Incorrect work interpretation
   - **Mitigation**: Show reasoning, allow user correction

3. **Git State Corruption**: Breaking repository
   - **Mitigation**: Dry-run mode, rollback capabilities

4. **Performance Impact**: Slowing down Claude Code
   - **Mitigation**: Async operations, caching, debouncing

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (Day 1)
- Git suggestions appear after work completion
- User can approve/modify/skip suggestions
- Approved operations execute successfully

### Short-term (Week 1)
- 0 instances of 100+ uncommitted changes
- 80% suggestion acceptance rate
- Clean git state after all sessions

### Medium-term (Month 1)
- Meaningful commit history
- Appropriate branching strategies
- Well-structured PRs

### Long-term (Quarter 1)

- Proactive workflow suggestions
- Team-wide adoption

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve architecture
2. Create detailed implementation plan

4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Establish testing framework
6. Deploy to test project
7. Gather user feedback
