# üö® REALITY CHECK: What Actually Works vs What Doesn't

**Generated**: 2025-08-26 11:20  
**Purpose**: Document the ACTUAL state of claude-automations systems

## üî¥ Critical Findings

### The Good News
- ‚úÖ Hooks, commands, and agents ARE properly symlinked in `~/.claude/`
- ‚úÖ PRISM MCP server IS running and accessible
- ‚úÖ 109 slash commands are available
- ‚úÖ `/commit` and other commands work when manually invoked

### The Bad News
- ‚ùå **NO SQLite database exists** for PRISM (only schema.sql)
- ‚ùå **PRISM has 0 uses** - agents aren't using it
- ‚ùå **Auto-commit hooks aren't triggering** (virtual-tutor has 361 uncommitted files!)
- ‚ùå **No observability** - can't tell what's running or failing

## üìä System Status Breakdown

### 1. PRISM System
**Location**: `~/claude-automations/prism/`

| Component | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| MCP Server | Running | Running | ‚úÖ Works |
| SQLite Database | Populated | Doesn't exist | ‚ùå BROKEN |
| Manifest Collection | Auto-collecting | 6 manifests, 0 uses | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |
| Agent Integration | Agents use context | 0 agent uses | ‚ùå BROKEN |
| Virtual-tutor Deploy | Integrated | No evidence | ‚ùå Unknown |

**Evidence**:
```bash
# MCP Stats showing it's running but unused:
{
  "total_manifests": 6,
  "total_uses": 0,
  "agents_tracked": 0,
  "avg_relevance_7d": 0
}

# No database file exists:
ls ~/claude-automations/prism/database/
# Only schema.sql, no .db file
```

### 2. Git Auto-Commit System
**Location**: `~/.claude/hooks/smart-auto-commit.py`

| Component | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Hook Installation | In ~/.claude/hooks | ‚úÖ Present | ‚úÖ Installed |
| Triggering | Every 30 min | Never triggers | ‚ùå BROKEN |
| Virtual-tutor | Auto-commits | 361 uncommitted files | ‚ùå BROKEN |
| Claude-automations | Auto-commits | Manual commits needed | ‚ùå BROKEN |

**Root Cause**: Unknown - hook exists but doesn't fire

### 3. Slash Commands
**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`

| Component | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Installation | 109 commands | 109 commands present | ‚úÖ Works |
| `/commit` | Smart commits | Works when invoked | ‚úÖ Works |
| `/start-prompt` | Project analysis | Works (v1.1.0) | ‚úÖ Works |
| `/continuation-prompt` | Session handoff | Works (v1.1.0) | ‚úÖ Works |

### 4. Event Hooks
**Location**: `~/.claude/hooks/`

| Component | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Installation | 32 hooks | 32 hooks present | ‚úÖ Installed |
| Execution | Auto-trigger | No evidence of running | ‚ùå Unknown |
| Logging | Track activity | No logs found | ‚ùå Missing |

## üîç Why Things Don't Work

### 1. **No Event System**
Claude Code hooks are installed but there's no evidence they're being triggered by actual events. We don't know:
- What events Claude Code actually fires
- If hooks are bound to those events
- If they're failing silently

### 2. **No Observability**
We have no way to know:
- Which hooks are running
- Which are failing
- What errors occur
- When things last ran

### 3. **Missing Integration Layer**
- PRISM MCP exists but agents don't use it
- Auto-commit exists but doesn't trigger
- Systems are isolated, not integrated

### 4. **Project-Level Deployment Missing**
- Virtual-tutor doesn't have project-specific hooks
- No `.git/hooks` integration
- No project-level configuration

## üö® Immediate Problems

1. **Virtual-tutor has 361 uncommitted files** despite auto-commit hooks
2. **PRISM has collected 0 context** despite being "running"
3. **No database exists** for PRISM intelligence
4. **No logs or monitoring** to diagnose issues

## ‚úÖ What DOES Work

1. **Manual Commands**
   - `/commit` generates smart commits
   - `/start-prompt` analyzes projects
   - `/continuation-prompt` creates handoffs
   - All 109 commands are accessible

2. **MCP Servers**
   - PRISM MCP responds to queries
   - Other MCP servers (context7, github, etc.) work

3. **Directory Structure**
   - Proper symlinks in `~/.claude/`
   - Organized codebase in `~/claude-automations/`

## üîß What Needs Fixing

### Priority 1: Make Auto-Commit Work
```bash
# Need to:
1. Add logging to smart-auto-commit.py
2. Understand Claude Code's event system
3. Test hook triggering mechanism
4. Deploy to virtual-tutor project
```

### Priority 2: Make PRISM Functional
```bash
# Need to:
1. Create actual SQLite database
2. Populate with manifest data
3. Connect agents to use PRISM context
4. Add tracking/metrics
```

### Priority 3: Add Observability
```bash
# Need to:
1. Central log file for all hooks
2. Status dashboard/command
3. Health check script
4. Error reporting
```

## üìã Action Items

1. **Create HEALTH_CHECK.sh** - Verify what's actually working
2. **Add logging everywhere** - Can't fix what we can't see
3. **Test hook triggers** - Understand Claude Code events
4. **Deploy to virtual-tutor** - Make it work in a real project
5. **Create monitoring** - Know when things break

## üéØ The Truth

**Most of the automation doesn't actually run automatically.** We have:
- Beautiful code that doesn't execute
- Hooks that don't trigger  
- Intelligence that doesn't collect
- Safety nets with holes

The system needs:
1. **Event binding** - Connect hooks to real events
2. **Observability** - See what's happening
3. **Integration** - Make systems work together
4. **Deployment** - Install in actual projects

Without these, we have sophisticated manual tools, not automation.
