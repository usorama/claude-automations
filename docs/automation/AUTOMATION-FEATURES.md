## üéØ Core Automation Systems

### 1. Real-Time Automation System
**File**: `core/automation/real-time-system.py`

**Purpose**: Monitors file changes and triggers automated actions in real-time.

**Features**:
- File system monitoring with debounced reactions
- Automatic manifest updates after file changes (5-second delay)
- Auto-commits every 30 minutes or after 50 file changes
- Automatic PR creation after 10 commits
- State persistence across sessions

**How it Works**:
1. Uses `watchdog` library to monitor file system events
2. Maintains pending changes queue with intelligent debouncing
3. Triggers manifest updates when changes settle
4. Creates checkpoint commits periodically or based on change volume
5. Automatically creates PRs when significant work accumulates

**Deployment**:
```bash
# Start for a project
python3 ~/.claude/automation/real-time-system.py /path/to/project

# Or from project directory
cd /path/to/project
python3 ~/.claude/automation/real-time-system.py
```

**Verification**:
- Check for state file: `~/.claude/automation/state.json`
- Monitor console output for checkpoint messages
- Look for auto-generated commits in git log
- Check for auto-created PRs on GitHub

---

### 2. Smart Manifest Update System
**File**: `core/automation/smart-manifest-update.py`

**Purpose**: Intelligently updates project manifests while preserving manual additions.

**Features**:
- Generates 8 different manifest types (project, API, database, component, test, security, deployment, dependencies)
- Incremental updates that merge with existing data
- Preserves manual sections marked with `_manual`
- Version tracking and change counting
- Automatic project type detection

**How it Works**:
1. Scans project structure to detect type (Node.js, Python, Rust, etc.)
2. Generates manifest data based on file patterns and content analysis
3. Intelligently merges new data with existing manifests
4. Preserves manual additions and tracks versions
5. Creates structured JSON/YAML documentation

**Deployment**:
```bash
# Update all manifests
python3 ~/.claude/automation/smart-manifest-update.py --incremental --preserve-manual

# Update specific manifest
python3 ~/.claude/automation/smart-manifest-update.py --manifest api-manifest.json
```

**Verification**:
- Check `.claude/manifests/` directory for generated files
- Look for `_metadata` section with version numbers
- Verify manual sections are preserved across updates

---

### 3. Auto-Checkpoint System
**File**: `core/hooks/auto-checkpoint-hook.py`

**Purpose**: Creates automatic git checkpoint commits to prevent work loss.

**Features**:
- Periodic checkpoints every 30 minutes
- Semantic commit messages based on changes
- Change summary generation (added/modified/deleted counts)
- Manual trigger support
- Operation-specific checkpoints

**How it Works**:
1. Tracks time since last checkpoint
2. Analyzes git status for uncommitted changes
3. Generates intelligent commit messages based on file types
4. Creates commits with descriptive summaries
5. Saves checkpoint timestamps for next run

**Deployment**:
```bash
# Run as daemon
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/auto-checkpoint-hook.py --daemon

# Force immediate checkpoint
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/auto-checkpoint-hook.py --now

# Checkpoint after specific operation
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/auto-checkpoint-hook.py --after "feature implementation"
```

**Verification**:
- Check `~/.claude/last_checkpoint.json` for timestamp
- Look for commits with "chore:", "feat:", "docs:" prefixes
- Monitor console for checkpoint messages

---

### 4. Session Lifecycle Manager
**File**: `core/hooks/session-lifecycle-manager.py`

**Purpose**: Manages Claude Code sessions with automatic commits, PRs, and branch management.

**Features**:
- Session tracking with start/stop/status commands
- Auto-checkpoints during active sessions
- Smart commit message generation
- Automatic PR creation after significant work
- Branch intelligence integration
- Activity monitoring with auto-commits

**How it Works**:
1. Detects Claude Code process activity
2. Monitors file changes and triggers commits at thresholds
3. Creates smart commits based on file categories
4. Automatically creates PRs after 5 commits or 2 hours
5. Integrates with branch intelligence for naming

**Deployment**:
```bash
# Start session management
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/session-lifecycle-manager.py start [project_path]

# Check status
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/session-lifecycle-manager.py status

# Stop session
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/session-lifecycle-manager.py stop
```

**Verification**:
- Check `~/.claude/current_session.json` for active session
- Monitor commit history for auto-generated messages
- Look for auto-created PRs on GitHub

---

### 5. Deploy Code Intelligence Script
**File**: `core/scripts/deploy-code-intelligence.sh`

**Purpose**: One-command deployment of all intelligence features to any project.

**Features**:
- Project type detection (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- GitHub workflows deployment
- Claude configuration setup
- Initial manifest generation
- Git branch intelligence integration
- Backup creation before deployment

**How it Works**:
1. Detects project type from package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
2. Backs up existing configuration
3. Deploys customized GitHub workflows
4. Creates/updates CLAUDE.md with intelligence sections
5. Generates initial manifests
6. Sets up branch intelligence and hooks

**Deployment**:
```bash
# Deploy to current directory
~/.claude/scripts/deploy-code-intelligence.sh

# Deploy to specific project
~/.claude/scripts/deploy-code-intelligence.sh /path/to/project
```

**Verification**:
- Check for `.claude/` directory in project
- Verify `.github/workflows/` contains new workflows
- Look for updated CLAUDE.md file
- Test manifest generation

---

### 6. Archon Documentation Sync
**File**: `archon-doc-sync.py`

**Purpose**: Syncs Claude Code and BMAD documentation to Archon knowledge base.

**Features**:
- Automatic sync every 3 hours (via cron)
- Checksum-based change detection
- Multi-source documentation gathering
- State persistence to avoid re-syncing
- Health checks before sync

**How it Works**:
1. Loads previous sync state with checksums
2. Scans documentation sources for changes
3. Compares checksums to detect modifications
4. Syncs only changed files to Archon
5. Updates state file with new checksums

**Deployment**:
```bash
# Manual sync
python3 ~/.claude/archon-doc-sync.py

# Add to crontab for automatic sync
0 */3 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /Users/umasankrudhya/.claude/archon-doc-sync.py
```

**Verification**:
- Check `~/.claude/archon-sync.log` for sync history
- Verify `~/.claude/.archon-sync-state.json` exists
- Monitor Archon for updated documentation

---

## üîó Hook Systems

### 7. Global Switch Processor
**File**: `core/hooks/global-switch-processor.py`

**Purpose**: Processes text replacement switches for enhanced prompts.

**Features**:
- Embeds switches directly in code (no external config)
- Supports multiple switches (-u, -r, -t, -p, -o)
- Real-time text replacement
- Integration with Claude Code hooks

**Switches**:
- `-u`: ultrathink - Deep thinking mode
- `-r`: research - Thorough research mode
- `-t`: think - Hard thinking mode
- `-p`: plan - Detailed planning mode
